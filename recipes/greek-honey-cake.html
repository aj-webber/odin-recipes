		<li>1 cup honey</li>
		<li>1 &frac34; cups white sugar, divided</li>
		<li>&frac34; cup water</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
		<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>1 &frac12 teaspoons baking powder</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
		<li>&frac12; teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
		<li>&frac14; teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>&frac34; cup unsalted butter</li>
		<li>3 eggs</li>
		<li>&frac14; cup milk</li>
		<li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
		<p>Combine honey, 1 cup sugar, and water in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook 5 minutes. Stir in 
		lemon juice; bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool while you prepare the cake.</p>
		<li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
		<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch square baking pan.</p>
		<li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
		<p>Combine flour, baking powder, orange zest, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl; set aside.</p>
		<li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>
		<p>Beat remaining 3/4 cup sugar and butter together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. 
		Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in flour mixture, alternating with milk, beating just until 
		incorporated; stir in walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</p>
		<li><h3>Step 5</h3></li>
		<p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.</p>		
		<li><h3>Step 6</h3></li>
		<p>Remove cake from oven and poke holes over the surface with a toothpick. Slowly ladle the cooled honey syrup 
		over cake. For best results, set cake aside for 4 to 6 hours to cool and absorb the syrup before slicing and serving.</p>
